<h4>New! Manage Your Leads</h4>
No more going between browser windows with the Lead Management interface. Now you can see and manage your leads right within the WordPress dashboard.

<h4>New! Form Integration</h4>
Until now the lead capture forms for IDX have been separate from the standard WordPress forms. With IMPress for IDX Broker you can create forms within WordPress and capture lead information straight into IDX Broker. At launch, the integration includes the popular form plugins of [Ninja Forms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninja-forms/), [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/), and [Gravity Forms](http://www.gravityforms.com/).

<h4>New! Selective Refresh</h4>
Selective refresh (WP 4.5 or later) is available for widgets in the customizer. When an edit is made to any widget, the change is made without having to reload the page.

<h4>Omnibar Search Widget</h4>
This widget allows you to add an Omnibar Search Widget to your home page. Visitors can then search by city, county, postal code, address, or listing ID. Custom Fields such as School or Subdivision can also be added. No other IDX solution offers this many options in a search widget for your home page.

<h4>Mobile Responsive and Mobile-Friendly</h4>
All of your templates and widgets will be responsive if you’re using a responsive theme. If you want to give visitors a more simplified, mobile app-like experience, simply activate mobile wrappers. Visitors can always select “View Full Site” to load the full version of your WordPress site on their mobile device. Only IMPress for IDX Broker offers this many options for your mobile visitors!

<h4>Native WordPress Widgets</h4>
Add widgets previously only available in the Equity framework – lead login, signup, city links, showcase, and carousel widgets. Take advantage of these new widgets to deliver the best experience, and style them to match the design of your site! 

<h4>Conveniently Add Shortcodes</h4>
An overhauled user experience makes this plugin easy to use. Easily add new widgets to pages and posts with built-in shortcodes.

<h4>Import Your Listings with IMPress Listings</h4>
Combine this plugin with [IMPress Listings](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-listings/) to import all your IDX properties into WordPress without wasting time on tedious data entry. You no longer have to manually enter your properties! Have them updated as the MLS changes – directly from your IDX Broker feed!

<h4>Capture and Convert Your Leads</h4>
Use powerful lead capture tools to generate new leads. Go beyond and customize your lead capture settings with [IDX Broker Platinum](https://www.idxbroker.com/categories/capture-and-retain-leads). 

<h4>Cloud Hosted, Never Framed</h4>
The IMPress for IDX Broker plugin links to pages on your site including your IDX Broker custom subdomain. This allows multiple unique URL results for each specific search engine query, leading to the best possible SEO results and more traffic from search engines. Don’t be fooled by the scare tactics used by those who suggest that IDX pages must always appear on your root WordPress domain.

<h4>Design Community</h4>
Only IMPress for IDX Broker gives you the ability to choose premium IMPress WordPress themes designed specifically around use with your IDX Broker account. [Agent Evolution](http://www.agentevolution.com/) (a division of IDX Broker) and other [Premium Real Estate Theme Designers](http://www.idxbroker.com/wordpress-idx-themes) offer deep integration with the IMPress plugin suite.

<h4>Map Search Widget</h4>
Add a full-sized [map search widget](http://www.idxbroker.com/features/map-search-widget) to ANY page on your domain. Create your own custom polygon searches with your IDX Broker Platinum account and allow visitors the ability to search within popular neighborhoods in your area.

<h4>Build Neighborhood Pages</h4>
Back up your expertise with neighborhood and community pages. Write a story, or a post, and use anchor tags to link your custom neighborhoods in IMPress for IDX Broker. That’s two indexed pages for the price of one!

<h4>The Best Office IDX Available</h4>
Assign leads to your agents exactly the way you want. Choose from multiple lead routing options, including [round robin](http://www.idxbroker.com/features/round-robin-and-core-fields-lead-routing), custom assignments for neighborhood pages, using a [showcase widget](https://www.idxbroker.com/features/listing-showcase-and-slideshow-widget), or by creating a unique [bio page](http://www.idxbroker.com/features/agent-bio-page-wrapper) for each agent!

<h4>Affordable Pricing</h4>

<h4>General Terms of Use</h4>
IMPress for IDX Broker uses the MLS/IDX feeds provided by your IDX Broker account. This means your MLS governs the display and disclaimers on your IDX results and details pages.

The IMPress for IDX Broker plugin will automatically display the correct MLS/IDX disclaimers to ensure compliance with the MLS(s) & Board(s) that provides you with your IDX feed.

5. Your plugin will now pull your IDX Broker account information into Wordpress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
 
= What is IDX? =
Internet Data Exchange, or IDX, is a type of data feed provided by your MLS. This data feed typically (but not always) mirrors the data available on your MLS's website. IMPress for IDX Broker connects to this data feed automatically, maps the necessary fields, and then adds forms, scripts, etc, giving you a way to add html links and widgets to your website(s).
 
= How does IDX Broker connect with the IMPress for IDX Broker plugin? =
An IDX Broker API key (separate purchase required) provides the IMPress plugin with access to preset Widgets, search forms, an xml sitemap file, and much more. 
 
= How is the IDX content hosted/updated? =
IDX Broker hosts your IDX data on a subdomain (e.g., search.yoursite.com). This allows IDX Broker to update quickly, and offers a lightning-fast, co-brandable search engine for real estate professionals and WordPress designers regardless of the quality of the hosting solution that you are using for your website. Low quality, inexpensive hosting solutions often cannot process or manage the amount of data provided by an IDX feed. 
 
= Why is IDX Broker hosted in the cloud? = 
All IDX feeds are hosted on high-quality Amazon AWS servers with multiple layers of redundancy. This ensures that even if your hosted website (mysite.com) goes down, your IDX Broker pages (search.mysite.com) will almost always be available to visitors.
 
= What is a Wrapper and why does IDX Broker need to create a Wrapper page on my WordPress site? =
The IMPress plugin offers an easy one-button option to create a Wrapper for IDX pages. This wrapper page is then used to magically update your IDX pages every hour, or whenever you modify/refresh your IDX Broker plugin page. This means less work for you or your website developer. 
 
= Do I need an IDX Broker Lite or Platinum account in order to use this plugin? =
Yes. All IDX feeds require approval from a local board or MLS. If you (or your client if a designer) are not a member of a local board or MLS, or the MLS does not provide an IDX data feed, then you will be unable to add IMPress for IDX Broker plugin functionality to your WordPress site. 
 
= Is my service area available? =
<a href="http://www.idxbroker.com/idx_mls_coverage">Read more about our MLS coverage.</a> Note that some MLS's may charge you a separate fee for access to your IDX feed.
 
= Does IDX Broker require a long-term contract like other IDX services? =
No. IDX Broker requires a month-to-month agreement only. 
 
= What is the pricing for IDX Broker services? =
There are three monthly account levels - Agent ($39.99+), Team ($69.99+), and Office ($98.99+). <a href="https://www.idxbroker.com/idx_broker">Read more about pricing.</a>
 
= What can I expect if I decide to get my IDX feed through IDX Broker? =
When you sign up for a new account our MLS team will send you a Docusign email (or PDF). Simply add your signature to the Docusign file or PDF in order to proceed. If you are not a Principal Broker, and have provided us with your Broker name and contact information, we will then forward the same paperwork to your Broker for approval. Once we receive the paperwork from your Broker, we will send to the MLS for data approval. MLS approval can take anywhere from 3-10 days. Once approved, we will activate your account, integrate your site's design into IDX pages, and send you IDX Broker login credentials so that you can use this plugin to add links and Widgets to your site or blog.
 
= How many blogs/websites can I integrate with IDX Broker? =
Features provided by this Plugin - Widgets, links, and custom links may be placed onto any WordPress website or blog. The reason for this is because all Widgets, links, and custom links point back to the original IDX-approved website. Note that using iframes to display this same content is prohibited and may result in account termination due to MLS rules. 
 
= What are Other Requirements for this Plugin? =
This plugin requires a PHP version higher than 5.4. For security reasons, we recommend updating to the latest stable version of PHP your web host provides. We also recommend using the latest production version of WordPress. See <a href="http://support.idxbroker.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1917460-wordpress-plugin?b_id=10433">this article</a> for more information.
